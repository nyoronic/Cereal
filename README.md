Yet Another Flashcard program based on spaced repetition

WIP, the documentation will be in Hungarian language. I will steal ideas from Cerego, Memrise and FluentU.

Used with Chrome Web Storage only.

I use my own algorithm (the main reason why I will publish this project).

I have problems with reading and writing, and I need to create a specialized freeware for my learning problems that
I experience while using the popular websites (programs) implementing the idea of computer-assisted language learning.

I do not want to be a lonely wolf developer, you can copy/fork this project after you've sent me a PM about your code.
